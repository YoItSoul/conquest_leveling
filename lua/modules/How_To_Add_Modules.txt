If you have a pre-packaged module produced by Soul, you can simply drop it into this folder.

The "Modules" folder is what is loaded by the exp system base, and is also where you should make
custom modules if that is your plan. Custom modules MUST FOLLOW THE TEMPLATE BELOW.

"sv_" must be the start of any server files
"sh_" must be the start of any shared files
"cl_" must be the start of any client files
Eg. "cl_conquest", "sh_conquest_config", and "sv_conquest" found in the base module.

If they do not contain the examples above, the files will not be loaded in correctly
and your module may not show up in-game as a conquest module.
